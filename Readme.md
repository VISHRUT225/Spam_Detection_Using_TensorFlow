## 📢 Introduction

Spam emails pose a persistent threat in the digital world, necessitating robust solutions for their timely identification and filtering. This project leverages machine learning, specifically TensorFlow, to construct a model capable of accurately detecting spam emails based on the SMS Spam Collection Dataset.

## 🎯 Objective

The primary goal of this project is to develop an effective machine learning model capable of distinguishing between spam and non-spam emails. The study encompasses data preparation, model building using TensorFlow, and thorough evaluation of the model's performance on a test set.

## 📑 Dataset

The [Spam Mails Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/venky73/spam-mails-dataset) is used for this study. It includes labeled email texts as spam or ham, forming the basis for training and evaluating the machine learning model.
